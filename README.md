# IDS

This report summarizes the experiments performed to evaluate multiple classification models on a network intrusion detection dataset (CIC dataset). The goal is to detect and classify network traffic into normal (Benign) or multiple attack categories, using feature selection and various machine learning models.
Key objectives:
• Perform dimensionality reduction via PCA for feature selection.
• Train and evaluate multiple classification models.
• Analyze the impact of varying the number of estimators on ensemble models (Random Forest and XGBoost).
• Compare model performance using standard evaluation metrics and visualize results.
